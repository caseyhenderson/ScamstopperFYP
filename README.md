# ScamstopperFYP
A Google Dialogflow for helping less technologically confident users avoid online scams and improve their confidence using the Internet. Part of my Final Year Project.
This repository holds the files for the Dialogflow chatbot itself. The repository for the web application can be found at https://github.com/caseyhenderson/scamstopper-ui and the application itself is currently deployed at https://river-cocoa-377215.web.app/ .
